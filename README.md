- **Dark Mode:** Supports dark mode toggle for better user experience in low-light environments.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Clean UI:** Simple and modern user interface for clear presentation of portfolio projects.
- **GitHub & Vercel Links:** Each project includes direct links to the source code on GitHub and live deployment on Vercel.
